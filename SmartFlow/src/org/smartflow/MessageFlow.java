/*A Message Flow is used to show the flow of messages between two participants/processes 
 * (see section 7.4.1) that are prepared to send and receive them. In BPMN, two separate Pools 
 * in the Diagram will represent the two participants/processes 
 * (e.g., business entities or business roles). All Message Flow must connect two separate Pools. 
 * They can connect to the Pool boundary or to Flow Objects within the Pool boundary. 
 * They cannot connect two objects within the same Pool.
